    <text id="ABOUT_TEXT">  The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by	creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.\n Conway was interested in a problem presented in the 1940s by mathematician John von Neumann, who attempted to find a hypothetical machine that could build copies of itself and succeeded	when he found a mathematical model for such a machine with very complicated rules on a rectangular grid.\n The Game of Life emerged as Conway's successful attempt to drastically simplify von Neumann's ideas. </text>

    <text id="RULES">
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite grid of square cells, each of which is alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours. 
At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system.  
The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
